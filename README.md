Identifying ways to improve the accessibility, performance, and SEO ranking of RightLabs' website using web standards and industry-recommended best practices

## Methodology

I audited [RightLabs' home page](https://rightlabs.com/) using Google Chrome's "Audits" panel, [the aXe accessibility extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd), [WebAIM's WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/), [the HTML5 Outliner extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html5-outliner/afoibpobokebhgfnknfndkgemglggomo?hl=en), [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), and [Think With Google's Test My Site](https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/).

I will be summarizing these analyses, along with proposed solutions, in the "Areas For Improvement" section below. Where relevant, I will be including quotes from people in the industry to offer further explanation for the solutions I've proposed.
